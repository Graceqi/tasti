This is the official project page for "Task-agnostic Indexes for Deep Learning-based Queries over Unstructured Data"

Please read the [paper](https://google.com) for full technical details.

# Requirements

For requirements, take a look at requirements.txt. You can automatically install everything with:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

To reproduce the experiments of `night-street` (referenced in paper) your machine will need:
- 300+GB of memory
- 500+GB of space
- A GPU (this has only been tested with NVIDIA P100 and V100)

Hardware requirements will vary depending on the dataset and hyperparameters.
